# Pudding
The name comes from the fact that I just ate a pudding.

# How to use

# Caution
1.This is my first work. I'm sure there will be bugs and glitches, but please be gentle with it, as if you were teaching your child how to ride a bike for the first time.

2.Due to the specification of the tool, Webhook and Bot are used simultaneously. Therefore, the Bot can be called in all channels, but the Webhook only works in one channel. If you have a closed server with only one chat channel, you should be fine, but if you don't, you may want to create a dedicated channel for this tool.
